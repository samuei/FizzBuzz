# FizzBuzz

FizzBuzz is a classic programming algorithms exercise. The idea is to print the 
numbers from 1 to 100 (inclusive), replacing any number divisible by 3 with 
"Fizz", any number divisible by 5 with "Buzz", and any number divisible by both 
with "FizzBuzz".

It's generally a simple exercise, but some languages present unique challenges 
to execution.
